             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul type="circle">
                <li>2 Tablespoons <b>olive oil</b></li>
                <li>2 &frac12; to 3 pounds <b>beef chuck roast</b></li>
                <li><b>Kosher salt</b></li>
                <li><b>Freshly ground pepper</b></li>
                <li>2 (1-ounce) packages <b><a href="./dry-onion-soup-mix.html">dry onion soup mix</a></b></li>
                <li>2 cups <b>water</b></li>
                <li>2 (14.5-ounce) <b>cans beef broth</b></li>
                <li>6-8 slices <b>swiss</b> or <b>provolone cheese</b></li>
                <li>6-8 <b>crusty rolls</b></li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <p>Makes 8 servings.</p>
             <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil (2 <small>Tbps</small>) in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, generously season all sides of the chuck roast with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
                 <li>When the oil starts to shimmer, carefully place the roast in the hot pan and sear it on all sides by letting it sit without moving for a minute or two on each side before flipping it. Quickly brown the roast to add flavor and sear in the juices.</li>
                 <li>Transfer the roast and the pan juices to your slow cooker. Sprinkle <a href="./dry-onion-soup-mix.html">onion soup mix</a> over the roast and add water (2 cups) and beef broth (2 - 14.5 ounce cans). Cook on high for 4-6 hours or on low for 8-10 hours.</li>
                 <li>When the meat is so tender it shreds easily with a fork, remove the roast from the slow cooker and shred. Serve by piling the shredded meat onto sliced, crusty rolls with a slice of Swiss cheese. Toast the cheese and top bun under the broiler until the cheese melts and the bun starts toasting. Serve with juices from the slow cooker as aus ju for dipping.</li>
             </ol>
