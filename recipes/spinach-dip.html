        <ol>

            <li>Thaw the box of <b>frozen chopped spinach</b> using your preferred method. The microwave is a quick and easy way just follow the instructions on the spinach packaging.</li>

            <li>Follow the directions on the <b>Knorr&reg; Recipe Mix</b> reduce it to a thicker consistency and leave it sitting to cool.</li>

            <li>Drain and chop the 8<small>oz</small> can of <b>chestnuts</b>.</li>

            <li>Chop the 3 <b>green onions</b> and the <b>scallion bulbs</b> store the green stem of the scallions for later use.</li>

            <li>Once the cooked <b>Knorr&reg; Recipe Mix</b> has cooled, and the <b>chopped spinach</b> has fully thawed, pull out a medium to large sized mixing bowl and mix all the ingredients together well. Using a small mixer on slow speed can help make the process easier, but a wooden spoon or spatula will work just as well.</li>

            <li>Once mixed cover the bowl with cling on and leave it to sit in the fridge for a few hours, overnight is better, or until the entire mixture has chilled to a firm consistency.</li>

            <li>Transfer the dip into your preferred serving bowl, with some crackers chips or vegetables and enjoy!</li>
